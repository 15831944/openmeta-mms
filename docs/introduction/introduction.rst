Introduction

The OpenMETA Tools
------------------

The OpenMETA tool kit is an integrated, open source, model-based platform
used to design and analyze complex systems. While the OpenMETA tools have
been used to create satellite and vehicular systems, they excel at
electronic hardware design. OpenMETA users can create a design with
integrated schematic, PCB, thermal, power usage and cost information.
The process will allow users to create functional hardware products
without requiring expert level electronics experience.

Benefits of OpenMETA
--------------------

-  Create and maintain a unified model that leverages various domain
   models in one location (i.e. CAD, Behavioral, Schematic, Data sheet)
-  Allow designers to consider and analyze all of the component choices
   available for a design.
-  Quickly rule out infeasible design choices through the use of
   constraints.
-  Allow designers to directly evaluate designs against design
   requirements.
-  Rapidly make changes due to changing requirements, new technology, or
   design changes.
-  Leverage the capabilities of complex domain tools without requiring
   expertise.
-  View data for a large number of designs at once.
-  Allow designers to create components from scratch or import
   components from outside of our library.
-  Gauge the cost of ideas before designs are finalized.
