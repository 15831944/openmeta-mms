Introduction
============

The OpenMETA Tools
------------------

The OpenMETA tool kit is an integrated, open source, model-based platform
used to design and analyze complex systems. While the OpenMETA tools have
been used to create satellite and vehicular systems, they excel at
electronic hardware design. OpenMETA users can create a design with
integrated schematic, PCB, thermal, power usage and cost information.
The process will allow users to create functional hardware products
without requiring expert level electronics experience.

Benefits of OpenMETA
--------------------

-  Create and maintain a unified model that leverages various domain
   models in one location (i.e. CAD, Behavioral, Schematic, Data sheet)
-  Allow designers to consider and analyze all of the component choices
   available for a design.
-  Quickly rule out infeasible design choices through the use of
   constraints.
-  Allow designers to directly evaluate designs against design
   requirements.
-  Rapidly make changes due to changing requirements, new technology, or
   design changes.
-  Leverage the capabilities of complex domain tools without requiring
   expertise.
-  View data for a large number of designs at once.
-  Allow designers to create components from scratch or import
   components from outside of our library.
-  Gauge the cost of ideas before designs are finalized.

How to Use This Documentation
-----------------------------

This documentation should be used a both an installation guide and primer for
those who are beginning to learn OpenMETA as well as a reference guide for
experience users.

The :ref:`installation` chapter explains all you need to know to set up the
tools on your computer.

The :ref:`concepts` and :ref:`ledtutorial` chapters explain the key concepts
and modeling elements used when building and editing OpenMETA models and then
guide the user through the building and analysis of a simple LED example model.

The :ref:`walkthroughs` chapter showcases a couple of example models that
demonstrate the power of the OpenMETA tools.

The :ref:`domains` chapter enumerates all the major domains that have been
integrated with OpenMETA; covers how to configure these domain-specific external
tools to work with OpenMETA; and explains the domain-specific
model elements, attributes, and principles for each domain.

The :ref:`resultsbrowser` and :ref:`visualizer` chapters describe the tools
provided with OpenMETA to manage and visualize the generated Test Bench and
Parametric Exploration Tool results.

Finally, the :ref:`reference` and :ref:`connectors` appendices are used for
reference and understanding of some of the more complex concepts within
OpenMETA.
