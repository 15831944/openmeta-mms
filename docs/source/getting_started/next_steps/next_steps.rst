Next Steps
==========

Now that you have installed the tools and successfully run a simple
analysis with OpenMETA, we recommend you complete the one or more of
the tutorials in the following chapters.

Tutorials
---------

The :ref:`led_tutorial` guides the user through the building and
analysis of a simple LED example model.
The :ref:`walkthroughs` chapter showcases a couple of example models that
demonstrate the power of the OpenMETA tools.


Then when you are comfortable with the tools, reading the reference chapters
will help solidify the concepts of the OpenMETA modeling environment.

Reference - Modeling
--------------------

The :ref:`openmeta_projects` explains more about how an OpenMETA projects
are stored on your computer and how they can be managed using a Version
Control System (VCS).

The :ref:`components`, :ref:`component_assemblies`, and :ref:`design_spaces`
chapters cover the key concepts and modeling elements used to create a model
of a system and express the variability of that system.

The :ref:`interpreters`, :ref:`test_benches` chapters describe the tools
used for code generation or the creation of executable analysis in a single
domain.

The :ref:`pet` chapter covers OpenMETA's multi-disciplinary analysis framework.
PETs allows for OpenMETA test benches and external tools from multiple
domains to be composed as analysis blocks in a single analysis workflow.
These workflows can then be executed using design of experiments or
optimization drivers.

The :ref:`domains` chapter enumerates all the major domains that have been
integrated with OpenMETA and covers how to configure OpenMETA with the
necessary domain-specific external tools. Furthermore, this chapter explains
the domain-specific model elements, attributes, and principles for each domain.

Reference - Execution
---------------------

The :ref:`results_browser` and :ref:`visualizer` chapters describe the tools
provided with OpenMETA to manage and visualize the generated Test Bench and
Parametric Exploration Tool results.

Appendices
----------

The :ref:`reference` and :ref:`connectors` appendices are used for
reference and understanding of some of the more complex concepts within
OpenMETA.

Finally, the :ref:`olddocs` chapter links to the old version of the
documentation.
