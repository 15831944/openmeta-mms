Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation for the OpenMETA tools.

The OpenMETA Tools
------------------

The OpenMETA tools are an integrated, open source, model-based platform
used to design and analyze complex systems. They comprise a modeling
environment, a test execution framework, and a results management and
visualization system.

The OpenMETA tools have been
used to create satellites, vehicular systems, and consumer electronics.
OpenMETA allows users to model a system with
multiple domains in a single model to better manage the synchronization
and interactions between these domains.


Benefits of OpenMETA
--------------------

-  Create and maintain a unified model that leverages various domain
   models in one location (i.e. CAD, Behavioral, Schematic, Data sheet)
-  Allow designers to consider and analyze all of the component choices
   available for a design.
-  Quickly rule out infeasible design choices through the use of
   constraints.
-  Allow designers to directly evaluate designs against design
   requirements.
-  Rapidly make changes due to changing requirements, new technology, or
   design changes.
-  Leverage the capabilities of complex domain tools without requiring
   expertise.
-  View data for a large number of designs at once.
-  Allow designers to create components from scratch or import
   components from outside of our library.
-  Gauge the cost of ideas before designs are finalized.

Using the Documentation
-----------------------

This documentation should be used as both an installation guide and primer for
those who are beginning to learn OpenMETA as well as a reference guide for
experienced users.
The first half covers everything you need to get started using OpenMETA
including installation instructions, step-by-step tutorials, and a plethora of
example models. The second half of the documentation clearly details the various
components of the OpenMETA tools and explains all the various concepts,
options, and attributes that are afforded by them.

If you are getting started, the next chapter will guide you through installing
the OpenMETA tools, and the :ref:`hello_world` chapter will walk you through
creating your first OpenMETA project.
When you have complete both these chapters, the :ref:`next_steps` chapter
will help you find the most useful next steps to gaining proficiency with
OpenMETA.
