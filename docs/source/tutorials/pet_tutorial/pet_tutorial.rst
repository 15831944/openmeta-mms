PET Tutorial
============

This chapter will serve as a tutorial covering a key
OpenMETA design concept: the :ref:`pet`.

You will learn how to create an OpenMETA PET analysis
using :ref:`pet_analysis_blocks` and configure the analysis with a
:ref:`pet_drivers_parameter_study` PET Driver.

Then, you will learn how to execute your PET with the *Master Interpreter*
and analyze the results, using both the :ref:`results_browser` and
the :ref:`visualizer`. From the results you will refine the analysis inputs
and re-execute your analysis.

Finally, you will be introduced to the :ref:`pet_drivers_optimizer` PET Driver
and see how it can be used to discover a minimum in the design space.
