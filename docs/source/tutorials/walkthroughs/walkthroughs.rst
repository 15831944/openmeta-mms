Walkthroughs
============

Each of the models below serves as a realistic example of using OpenMETA to
describe and design a complex system. We encourage you to clone each of the
repositories provided, explore the models, and experiment with changes of your
own!


.. _spacecraft_model:

Spacecraft Model
----------------

The OpenMETA Spacecraft project is an open-source project developed by
Metamorph to demonstrate the concepts of OpenMETA with a system model of a
fictitious satellite. The system model includes both CAD models and
OpenModelica models for a joint phyical and electrical analysis of the craft.

The OpenMETA Spacecraft Study project is here on GitHub:

.. _vahana_study:

A³ Vahana Trade Study
---------------------

The Vahana Trade Study conducted by A³ explored the design space of two
architecturally different vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) aircraft. We took
the open-source MATLAB scripts used for the trade study and incorporated them
into the OpenMETA environment where we used the Parametric Exploration Tool (PET)
to perform similar analyses of the Vahana model.
