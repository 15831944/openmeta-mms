Adding a Test Bench to a PET
----------------------------

When you want to use a Test Bench in a PET, you need to add a
*reference* to the Test Bench. This is done in the same manner that
you add components to Component Assembly. Just as described in the
:ref:`populate_the_component_assembly` section of the :ref:`led_tutorial`,
this is accomplished in one of two ways:

-  You can **Drag-and-drop** the desired Test Bench onto a PET
   canvas with a **Right-click** and select **Create Reference** from
   the drop-down menu.

-  Or you can **Right-click** on the desired Test Bench and select **copy**
   from the drop-down menu and then **Right-click** in the PET canvas
   and select :menuselection:`Paste Special --> As Reference` from the context
   menu.
