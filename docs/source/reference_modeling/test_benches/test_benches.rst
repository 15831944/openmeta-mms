Test Benches
============

The **Test Bench** is the primary tool for defining how a system model
should be translated into an executable, domain-specific model.

The :ref:`test_bench_basics` section gives a general overview of what
Test Benches are and how you can create, configure, and execute them.

The :ref:`cad_test_benches` section describes some of the CAD-specific
aspects of CAD Test Benches.

The :ref:`ara_test_benches` section describes the various Test Bench
templates that are included with OpenMETA that were originally developed
for OpenMETA under Project Ara.

The final :ref:`test_bench_utilities` section focuses on useful Test Bench
utilities.
