.. _spacecraft_model:

Spacecraft Model
----------------

The OpenMETA Spacecraft project is an open source project hosted
`here <https://github.com/metamorph-inc/openmeta-spacecraft-study>`_ on GitHub.
This project demonstrates the concepts of OpenMETA with a ficticious satellite
and includes CAD models as well as OpenModelica models for a joint phyical and
electrical analysis of the craft.

.. _vahana_study:

A³ Vahana Trade Study
---------------------

The Vahana Trade Study conducted by A³ explored the design space of two
architecturally different vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) aircraft. We took
the open-source MATLAB scripts used for the trade study and incorporated them
into the OpenMETA environment where we used the Parametric Exploration Tool (PET) 
to perform similar analyses of the Vahana model. The OpenMETA Vahana project is
hosted `here <https://github.com/metamorph-inc/openmeta-vahana>` on GitHub.

.. note:: The OpenMETA Vahana project is still in progress.
