Legacy Documentation
====================

Most of the documenation used in the Project Ara days has
been ported to this new rendering engine, but there are
still a few chapters that remain. You can still view the old
version of the documentation by navigating to
`OpenMETA Documentation <http://docs.metamorphsoftware.com/legacy>`_.
