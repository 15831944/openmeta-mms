Test Benches
============

The **Test Bench** is the primary tool for defining how a desired analysis
execution should be performed.

The :ref:`testbenchbasics` section gives a general overview of how to execute
a test bench. All the subsequent sections detail a specific test bench that
ships with the OpenMETA tools. These test benches were originally developed
for Project Ara.
