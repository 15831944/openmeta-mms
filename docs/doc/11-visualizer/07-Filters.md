This section appears at the bottom of all the tabs it pertains to, namely, Pairs Plot, Single Plot, Data Table, and Ranges.

**1. View All Filters**
	This selects between displaying ether filters for every variable or just filters for those variables chosen in the pairs tab (see Display Variables).

**2. Reset Visible Filters**
	This button will return the visible filters to their original state (fully opened).

**3. Filters**
	These filters (3 filters are shown above in the picture), will carve out the dataset to include only the points that fit within the ranges for each variable.  If you limit the dataset to have 0 points a message will appear in the pairs plot telling you that “there are no data points that fit the current filtering scheme”.
