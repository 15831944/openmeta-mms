Chapter 1:  Metamorphosys Tool Introduction {#meta-tool-introduction}
==================================

This chapter will provide you with information about the Metamorphosys Tools. Feel free to come back to this chapter and start installing the tools in Chapter 2.

## What Are The Metamorphosys Tools?

The META tool kit is an integrated, open source, model-based platform used to design and analyze complex systems.  While the META tools have been used to create satellite and vehicular systems, they excel at electronic hardware design.  META users can create a design with integrated schematic, PCB, thermal, power usage and cost information.  The process will allow users to create functional hardware products without requiring expert level electronics experience.  

## What Can Metamorphosys Do?

- Create and maintain a unified model that leverages various domain models in one location (i.e. CAD, Behavioral, Schematic, Data sheet)
- Allow designers to consider and analyze all of the component choices available for a design.
- Quickly rule out infeasible design choices through the use of constraints.
- Allow designers to directly evaluate designs against design requirements.
- Rapidly make changes due to changing requirements, new technology, or design changes.
- Leverage the capabilities of complex domain tools without requiring expertise.
- View data for a large number of designs at once.
- Allow designers to create components from scratch or import components from outside of our library.
- Gauge the cost of ideas before designs are finalized. 

## Metamorphosys Notes

### Windows Tools (Beta)
The Beta Version 14.10.1789  version of the Metamorphosys tools are available here. They run on Windows desktops using the Generic Modeling Environment (GME). 

### Metamorphosys vs. META Tools
You may see the Metamorphosys Tools being called META Tools throughout the tutorial. They are the same thing.

### Web Tools
As you may have heard, we are developing a browser-based version of the tools, with support for multi-user collaborative editing and improved design visualization. Click [**here**](http://mmsapp.metamorphsoftware.com/dispatch/mmsapp) to open a live demo. The functionality is still limited, so we recommend using the Windows tools during Beta.
