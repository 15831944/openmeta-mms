Welcome to the **Metamorphosys Windows Beta Testing Site**, supporting **Google's** [<b><i>Project Ara</i></b>](http://www.projectara.com/). The Windows Beta version of the Metamorphosys tools allows users to get familiar with our tools, and to start building and testing a module design. Testers will be able to bring their designs over to Web version of the tools in early Summer, with support for multi-user collaborative editing and improved design visualization.
