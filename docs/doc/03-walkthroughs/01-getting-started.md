## Getting Started

### Downloading the Tutorial Zip File
To complete this tutorial you will need to download the [<b>LED Tutorial Model</b>](http://docs.metamorphsoftware.com/alpha-releases/design-models/LED_Tutorial_Files.zip).

### Setting Up Directory
1. Once you've downloaded the tutorial model, unzip it and double-click `Walkthrough_LED.xme` to open it in the **GME**.
2. Save the project to the default directory (where your `.xme` file is located), taking note of this directory as you will need to access this location later in the tutorial. 

_Note: Be sure all the files (e.g. "components folder", `.xme` file) are in the same directory throughout the tutorial._
