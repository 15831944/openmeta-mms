## Toolbar

**New Window**

This button will open a new instance of the Results Browser.

**Select Results Folder**

This button allows you to specify a new working directory for the Results Browser. This directory must include at a minimum a 'results'Â folder with some results already generated.

**Refresh**

This button will force a refresh of the PET Tab and Test Benches Tab results lists. A refresh happens automatically at the conclusion of each active job.

**Cleanup**

This button cleans up the `results` folder, by moving any untracked folders from the `results` folder to the `_deleted` folder.  If you want to totally delete old data, you can remove this folder after using the Cleanup button.
