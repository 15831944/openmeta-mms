Autodesk Eagle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Autodesk Eagle <https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview>`_ is a free schematic and layout editor for electronic circuit design and the creation of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). When used in conjunction with OpenMETA, the user is able compose designs using a rich library of components in the tools and automatically generate ``.brd`` files from the model.

We recommend using the latest version of the EAGLE tools that can
be found on the `Autodesk Eagle Download Page
<https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download>`_.

Schematic Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Schematics** represent the elements of an electrical system using
abstracted symbols of components. Schematics excel at providing a clean,
efficient view of an electronic system. In electronic design the
location of the symbols in a schematic do not necessary correlate with
the physical location of the components. META currently uses **Eagle**
models to represent a component's schematic model.
