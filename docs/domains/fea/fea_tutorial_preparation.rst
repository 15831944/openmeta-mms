Tutorial Preparation
--------------------

Cloning the Tutorial Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To complete this tutorial you will need to acquire the FEA analysis tutorial
files. First clone the `OpenMETA Examples and Templates
<https://github.com/metamorph-inc/openmeta-examples-and-templates>`_ repository
to the location of your choosing. Then navigate to the ``fea-tutorial`` folder.

Launching the Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Once you've navigated to the tutorial model folder, double-click
   ``FEA_Tutorial.xme`` to open it in **GME**.
2. Save the project to the default directory (where your ``.xme`` file
   is located), taking note of this directory as you will need to access
   this location later in the tutorial.

.. note:: Be sure all the files (e.g. "components folder", ``.xme`` file)
   are in the same directory throughout the tutorial.*
