Tutorial Preparation
--------------------

Downloading the Tutorial Zip File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To complete this tutorial you will need to download the FEA analysis tutorial file .

Setting Up Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Once you've downloaded the tutorial model, unzip it and double-click
   ``FEA_Tutorial.xme`` to open it in **GME**.
2. Save the project to the default directory (where your ``.xme`` file
   is located), taking note of this directory as you will need to access
   this location later in the tutorial.

.. note:: Be sure all the files (e.g. "components folder", ``.xme`` file)
   are in the same directory throughout the tutorial.*
