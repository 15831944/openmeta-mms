SPICE Circuit Simulation
========================

**SPICE** is a time-tested, simulation tool for electronic circuits.
`NGSPICE <http://ngspice.sourceforge.net>`__ is an open-source version
that is used by and included with the OpenMETA tools.

NGSPICE Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

META components can use **NGSPICE** models to represent their electrical
behavior. They can do this by either parameterizing common SPICE primitives
or by providing their own implementations in standalone files.
