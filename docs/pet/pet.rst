Parametric Exploration Tool (PET)
=================================

The **Parametric Exploration Tool** allows for the creation of analysis
workflows by composing test benches and external tool wrappers. After a
workflow has been defined, different drivers can be added to execute the
workflow and record data.

This chapter serves as reference for all the PET tools and features. The
:ref:`pet_tutorial` chapter offers an example of building a PET workflow,
executing it, and analysing the results.
