Getting Started
---------------

To view all the results of this tutorial you should install Autodesk EAGLE as
described in the :ref:`eda` subchapter. If you choose not to install EAGLE, you
will still be able to complete the whole tutorial.

Downloading the Tutorial Zip File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete this tutorial you will need to get a copy of the tutorial files.
You can do this in one of two ways:

1. Clone the `OpenMETA Examples and Templates
   <https://github.com/metamorph-inc/openmeta-examples-and-templates>`_
   repository. You will then find the necessary files in the ``led-tutorial``
   folder.
2. Download the `LED Tutorial Model
   <http://docs.metamorphsoftware.com/alpha-releases/design-models/LED_Tutorial_Files.zip>`_
   zip file. Unzip this folder to the location of your choice.

Setting Up Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Once you've acquired and navigated to the tutorial files, double-click
   ``LED_Tutorial.xme`` to open it in the **GME**.
2. Save the project to the directory provided by GME (where your ``.xme`` file
   is located), taking note of this directory as you will need to access
   this location later in the tutorial.

.. note:: Resources in the OpenMETA project are referenced relative to the
   ``.mga`` or ``.xme`` project file and this relationship must be maintained.
   For example, you must not move the ``components/`` folder that is included
   in this example.
