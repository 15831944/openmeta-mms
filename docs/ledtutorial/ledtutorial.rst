LED Tutorial
============

This chapter will serve as a tutorial that illustrates the OpenMETA
design concepts. We will build a beginner-level circuit to teach the
basic fundamentals of the tools.

In this tutorial you will first learn how to build an OpenMETA *Component
Assembly*. From this component assembly we will generate some schematics and
perform a simple electrical analysis and simulation. Then we will introduce the
OpenMETA concept of a *Design Space*. This design space will allow us to
perform the earlier analyses on a family of designs.
