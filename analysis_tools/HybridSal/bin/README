
Prerequisites:
--------------
This is a precompiled version of HybridSal analysis tool
for Windows platform.  It was built on win32, but hopefully
it should work on other win platforms too.

Installation
-------------
Run "python install.py"

Running the above installation script should tell you what
is missing.  Most likely, SAL would be missing.

HybridSAL uses SAL model checkers. To install, follow these steps:
(1) Install cygwin: install the basic/default variety
    (Doesn't take too long, but need fast internet connection)
    (google on cygwin: www.cygwin.com)
(2) Download sal-3.2 tgz file for Windows/cygwin (sal.csl.sri.com)
(3) Move sal-3.2.tgz to a place inside cygwin, such as,
    c:\cygwin\home\<username>(4) Open a cygwin shell, Unpack sal and run install.sh script there
(5) Update PATH variable with path to sal (mentioned by install.sh)

Now, do "python install.py" for installing HybridSal (as above).



Running HybridSal:
------------------
Run
 ./hsalRA.exe <ModelicalXML-file> <Property-file>

For example, run:

./hsalRA.exe examples/MassSpringDamperTest.MassSpringDamperTest.xml examples/MassSpringDamperTest.property.json
